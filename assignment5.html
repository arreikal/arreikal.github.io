                    This circuit uses a mosfet 30n06l (N) transistor with a fan motor as the load (from drain), arduino pin 6 connected to gate, and ground (wall) as drain.
                    Pin 6 is controlled by input from an IR sensor and remote, connected to pins 2, Arduino Ground and +5V. 
                    Also determined by the input of the IR sensor is RGB LED, connected through resistors to pins 11, 10, 9, as well as Arduino Ground.

                    Resistor Rational:
                    <br>
                    For Blue LEDs: <br>(5V-3.3V)=(0.02A)(X)<br>(1.7V)=(0.02A)(X)<br>X=85 Ohms  <br>Round up to 100 Ohm resistor.<br><br>
                    For Green, Red LEDs: <br>(5V-1.8V)=(0.02A)(X)<br>(3.2V)=(0.02A)(X)<br>X=160 Ohms  <br>Round up to 220 Ohm resistor.<br><br>

                    Voltages:
                    <br>
                    The load is connected to a 12V AC adapter wall plug. This power goes throught the fan, and through the transistor and back out to ground. 
                    There is also a 5V power source that comes from the arduino output pin. This goes to the transistor to open the gate and let the power flow through the fan's loop.
                    The 5V power pin is also used to power the IR sensor.

                This is a Gif of the operation of the [Heating and] Cooling Device. The way this works is that
                the up arrow on the remote initiates the "heating" mode (really it just turns on a warm-toned light),
                and the down arrow on the remote operates the cooling mode, which turns on the fan and a cool-toned light.
                <br>
                <br>The IR Remote sends a IR signal to the IR sensor, which is then decoded in the arduino code, and depending on
                which button was pressed, either outputs LOW power or HIGH power to the gate of the transistor. The transistor gate opens when
                the voltage is HIGH, which completes the circuit for the fan (the load of the transistor, connected to drain), which is connected to 12V power
                from the wall.
                <br>
                <br>
                Unresolved bugs:
                <br>
                I intended for this code to be able to toggle the fan on and off based on the remote up and down buttons,
                however, after the cooling button was pushed, it would stop reading other buttons or acting on them. Because of this,
                I was only able to turn the fan on once without having to re-upload the code to the Arduino. I was unable to 
                troubleshoot this.
