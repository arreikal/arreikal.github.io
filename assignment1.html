                <p class="white">This is my schematic of the circuit. It is made of 4 LEDs (from left to right: Blue, Green, Yellow, Red)
                    and a corresponding resistor before each one. The Pins from the arduino are 5V when on high, so I used Ohms law to calculate
                    the resistor current for each LED. The calculations are as follow: <br><br>
                    For Blue LED: <br>(5V-3.3V)=(0.02A)(X)<br>(1.7V)=(0.02A)(X)<br>X=85 Ohms  <br>Round up to 100 Ohm resistor.<br><br>
                    For Green, Yellow, Red LEDs: <br>(5V-1.8V)=(0.02A)(X)<br>(3.2V)=(0.02A)(X)<br>X=160 Ohms  <br>Round up to 220 Ohm resistor.<br><br>
                    After passing through the LEDs, all wires connect back to Ground. <br><br>

            <p class="white">I hope you enjoyed this surprise music video. To make the lights match up, it was alot of trial and error and running the code 
                over and over again. I also looked up sheet music to calculate the length of the notes in ms by converting the BPM of the song to the length of 
                quarter notes. This took a bit to get timed right, but after I thought I had got the first few seconds worked out, and finally was able to start the song and the operation of the lights at the same time,
                I was shocked to see that it repeated exactly in time with the rest of the intro as well! This would have been even betterr if I matched up the lights
                with the rest of the song, but obviously this was a very time-intensive process, so I stopped after the intro. Hope this was a surprise!
